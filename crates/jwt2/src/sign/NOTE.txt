The reason why I've separated the implementations like this is because
I'm still in the process of figuring jwt2 out.

I may have jwt2 switch to using `ring` in the future, or maybe I'll split the
algorithm implementations into their own separate crates so that you can choose
whether you want to use `ring` or the `RustCrypto` family.
